# vinEvPy-antarjnan
This is numpy pytorch tensorflow implementation of all ml algorithms

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

Antarynan provide following features:
-pytorch -tensorflow -numpy implementation of alll the supervised and usupervised learning algorithms:
